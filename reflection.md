- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    All attributes are private. I have methods to access or to modify them. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Follow the instructions, create the classes one at a time, and finally compile them together to run in the main.
    Understanding which class the methods belong is the key. 
    Always test the codes to see how it works and improve it as you go.
